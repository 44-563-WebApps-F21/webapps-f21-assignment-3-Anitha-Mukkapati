    <h6>My Favorite place in the world is Maldives</h6>
    <p>The Maldives, a collection of more than a thousand islands in the <b>Indian Ocean</b> , is known for its clear emerald waters, 
        beautiful beaches that stretch as far as the eye can see, and of course <b>luxurious overwater bungalows</b>.
        With features like these, the archipelago makes for an idyllic sanctuary where guests can <b>snorkel</b>, <b>scuba dive</b>, 
        <b>swim</b>, and <b>savor</b> some truly unforgettable sunsets. Aside from being one of the most <b>stunning island getaways in 
        the world</b>, the Maldives is also a perfect addition to an itinerary for travelers visiting magnificent South Asian 
        cities or Middle Eastern capitals.
